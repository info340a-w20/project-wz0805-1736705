Our website is called MoodRecipe, you can open by clicking [Here](https://info340a-w20.github.io/project-wz0805-1736705/).

  The overarching goal of the “mood” recipes application will be recommending recipes to the users. It will let the users answer several questions, and the system will automatically recommend recipes to them based on the answers. For example, on a cold winter night, you and your family members are celebrating for your graduation, and you want to eat some warm Asian food😋, the system will be likely to recommend you Chinese Spicy Hotpot, Japanese Sukiyaki, Korean Budae Jjigae, and some similar food which can make you warmer, good for sharing. The system can make the best choices based on your own answers.😀
